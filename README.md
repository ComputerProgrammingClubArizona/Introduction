Introduction to the Computer Programming Club at the University of Arizona.

Our main activity is building software as a team.
We also have three primary objectives:
* To learn and facilitate learning.
* To gain practical experience developing applications.
* To network with like-minded and intelligent individuals.

This is our github organization page where we will host our repositories.
