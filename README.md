Introduction
============

Introduction to the Computer Programming Club at the University of Arizona.

Our primary activity is simply building software as a team, but we have three primary objectives:
	* Learn and to facilitate learning among all members.
	* Gain practical experience developing applications collectively.
	* Network with like-minded and intelligent individuals.

This is our github organization page where we will host our repositories.
